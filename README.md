Dynamic Programming Problems â€“ C Language

This repository contains solutions to some important dynamic programming problems that I have practiced and implemented using the C programming language. These problems help in understanding how to solve optimization problems efficiently by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

The problems included are:

1. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
   - Find the longest sequence in an array where elements are in increasing order.

2. Longest Divisible Subset (LDS)
   - Find the largest subset of numbers where each number is divisible by some other number in the subset.

3. Multistage Graph Problem
   - Find the minimum cost path from the source node to the destination node passing through multiple stages.

4. Minimum Path Sum in a Grid
   - Find the path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of a grid where the sum of all cells is minimized.

Feel free to explore the code, use it for practice, or suggest improvements. Happy learning and coding!
